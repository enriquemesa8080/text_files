Hello. I am a enterprise man. I want to make profit. But sometimes i think that some basic technologies must be open sourced.

For example: I give thanks to Linus Torvalds because he released a linux kernel who allows to anyone to run it on any computing device.

Currently i have no developed nothing yet. I want to disclose some basic feature but that is just if it is really needed. Personally i think
that open source is a good choice for learning for people who is entering in the computer world.

The computer world sometimes sees obscure due to lack of free projects who can teach people. I know that everybody needs profit, but i think
that some things must be opened to allow people to use them.

I think that open source must be non-commercial. I want to see more open source projects but with emphasis in learning. Many programmer needs
help. I think that the world needs better things. Needs a good network to showcase their projects and allow people to ask questions.

Personally i want to see some professional website with a forum style or Q&A style, could be paid. But allowing students to see free content or 
let them join the website building projects.

This is a great idea. I think that. 

I let my github project ready.
